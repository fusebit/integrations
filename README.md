# Fusebit Integrations
## üëã Welcome to Fusebit 

Our product enables developers like you to quickly add integrations to an application using powerful API building blocks. It takes away the pain of developing against many disparate APIs while maintaining the flexibility and familiarity of a code-first platform. Just like Stripe solves payments for application developers, Fusebit solves integrations.

This repository includes our official integrations packages for popular services and Fusebit SDK.
These packages are available when you create an integration, learn more about

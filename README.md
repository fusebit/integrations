## üíª Installation

Before using, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Node.js 14.17.6 or higher is recommended.

This project is using [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to facilitate package managing and publishing.

You need to install lerna globally

```bash
npm i -g lerna
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

### Install package dependencies

```bash
lerna bootstrap
```

### Build TypeScript

```bash
lerna run build
```

### If you want to filter command for certain package

```bash
lerna run <command> --scope=<package>
```

### Watch mode
Navigate to the package you're working on and run

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Run linter with auto fix

```bash
lerna run lint:fix
```

### Run prettier checks

```bash
npm run prettier:check
```

### Run prettier fix

```bash
npm run prettier:fix
```

### Run linter

```bash
lerna run lint
```
### Run linter fix

```bash
lerna run lint:fix
```

Note: As you may notice, we have some scripts at lerna level (per package) or root level (regular npm scripts), this is due all packages has different versions of dev dependencies (i.e TypeScript) - this is by design.

## Conventions

- Source folder: src
- Output directory: libc
- Sourcemaps enabled by default
- All the eslint plugins are using the recommended defaults


## Publishing a package


### Local environment

If you're developing locally, you may need to publish the packages to your Fusebit NPM registry, in order to do so, please follow up the following steps:

Right now we're releasing all packages under the same version, even if you're doing a change for only 1 package, that means, package publishing will update the versions and publish all the packages, we will support independent versioning in the future.

## 1. Ensure all your packages are ready
### 1.1 Linting passes
```bash
lerna run lint
```
### 1.2 Formatting passes (you need to be at the root level of the project.)
```bash
npm run prettier:check

### 1.3 Build passes
```bash
lerna run build

## 1.4 Bump packages version
```bash
lerna version < path | minor | major > --no-git-tag-version
```

If you want to skip prompts you can pass --yes argument to each command.
## 1.5 Publish packages

```bash
lerna publish --no-git-tag-version
```

Ensure you specify --no-git-tag-version otherwise a git tag will be created

## Versioning
Interactive prompt
### If you want to choose from an interactive prompt use

```bash
npm run packages:version
```

### Chosee between minor, patch and major releases

```bash
npm run packages:version [minor,patch,major]
```

This Integration lets you write a custom Slack crypto bot, using data from [CoinAPI](https://www.coinapi.io), 
which lets you track the performance of a crypto asset and make trading decisions.

For this to work, you need to register for an API key [here](https://docs.coinapi.io) and provide it
when you create the integration.
